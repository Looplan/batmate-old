Android app which takes an picture of an research map and automatically stores it under the right name in the cloud

## Why?

Employees of Loo Plan have prints of an map when they go out on research, this map is an map from the area they are researching.
When they research they often write some stuff down on that map, like an sighting, the temperature, the time they were there or something like the weather.
After the research is complete these prints need to be digitally stored, so they can be viewed later. 
The digitialisation of these prints was first done as follows:

1. Using an general photo to PDF app, take an photo and convert to PDF
2. Save the PDF under the correct name which is stated on the print.
3. Use the computer to upload the PDF to the cloud.

This could sometimes prove to be quite an pain for each employee to do this. 
So to tackle that this app was created which automates this process by doing everything on the app side.

1. Take photo with app.
3. User checks if automatically recognized name is correct
4. App uploads directly to the cloud.
